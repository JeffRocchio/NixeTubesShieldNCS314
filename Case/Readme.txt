Custom Wooden Case for Nixi Clock

With the help of a woodworking friend I make my own case for the clock. This folder contains some photos and FreeCAD files I used to help with the design and fabrication.

NOTE: File: Nixie_Clock_SHIELD_NCS314_v3.4-4Tubes.rar is a compressed, archive, file that contains a CAD 'step' file from the GRA & AFCH web site which contains a 3D rendering of the completed circut board (but without the Arduino). I didn't discover this existed until after I had made my case. Assuming this CAD file is accurate it could be a big help in using a CAD tool, such as FreeCAD, to design, dimension, and fabricate a case.
